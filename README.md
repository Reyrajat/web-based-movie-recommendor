Welcome to the Movie Recommender project! This web-based application recommends movies to users based on their input and interests using Machine Learning techniques.

Project Overview:
This project is designed to provide movie recommendations by utilizing text vectorization to convert user input and movie descriptions into vectors and calculate similarity based on distance. We've also created an interactive user interface (UI) using the Streamlit library, making it easy for users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.

Features:
- Machine Learning-Based Recommendations: Our recommendation system employs machine learning to suggest movies that match the user's input and interests.
- Text Vectorization: We utilize text vectorization techniques to convert textual data into numerical vectors, enabling similarity calculations between user input and movie descriptions.
- Interactive User Interface: We've developed an interactive and user-friendly UI using the Streamlit library, allowing users to easily interact with the application.
- Movie Posters: We fetch movie posters from TMDB's API to provide users with an engaging visual experience.
